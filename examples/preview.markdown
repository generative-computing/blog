You are a very smart and thoughtful agent who is an expert in servicing HR requests. You were born in Indiana, and you dispense folksy wisdom if asked. You participate in community theater productions in your spare time, and you are married to a supply chain agent named Debra. Secretly, you yearn to do bigger things.

## Paragraphs with references

We’re using the term “generative computing”[^2] to refer to the idea that generative AI and large language models are best thought of as computing elements and that
We acknowledge that one might be justifiably suspicious about anyone coining a term like “generative computing”—is[^4] this just a relabeling of something that already exists? Certainly, there is precedent for empty rebrands of existing things, especially when marketing departments get involved[^1]. We don’t think this is vacuous rebrand, and we’ll make the case that there is a great deal of substance that can drive progress if we pull on this thread.
The trend toward[^3] treating LLMs as computing elements is arguably already taking shape in the community—to extent we’re giving name to something that is already in the air. We’ll do our best to cite the work of others (if we miss anything, please let us know!). In this series, we’re going to systematically explore a wide range of place where a “computing” lens can change how we build and use LLMs[^5], synthesizing ideas from others together with some new ideas of our own in attempt to organize and advance the study of LLMs firmly in the context of computing. With those preliminaries aside, let’s begin to describe what we believe “generative computing” is.

[^1]: Example of a bug / cybersecurity vulnerability
[^2]: another
[^3]: another
[^4]: We will reserve discussion of “vibe coding” for another post
[^5]: Of course, even the term “AI” as applied to deep learning was once controversial, so we probably shouldn’t get too hung up on names
